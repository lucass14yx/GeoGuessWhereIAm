    <string name="acerca_de">GeoGuessWhereIAm is an interactive and educational application that challenges users to guess the location of a given place on a map. Users can select different difficulty levels, which determine the number of attempts they have and the radius within which they must guess the location. The application provides a fun way to test and improve geographic knowledge, with features such as real-time location tracking, map overlays, and visual markers. Users can also view their total points and learn more about the app through the "About" section. Developed by Alejandro and Lucas for the PMDM module.</string>
